    <p> Cameron is a Dalmatian Pitbull mix with a bit of poodle. He came to us from my sister Caroline when she broke up with James. He lived with James in North Carolina before coming to chicago and then to Michigan to live with Bud, Mina and Roland. When James and Caroline broke up he moved to seattle with our parents and is now in the lap of luxury.
